# joystick-shield.py
These codes were prepared using ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino Joystick Shield. The codes show you how to integrate the ESP32 with the Arduino Joystick Shield and control various functions of the joystick. This integration allows you to perform routing, selection and other interactive operations in ESP32-based projects using the joystick.
